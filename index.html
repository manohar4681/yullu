              Shared two-wheeler EVs are to ICE bikes what smartphones are to

              their ICE counterparts, not to forget significantly more
              affordable, writes Amit Gupta, Co-founder and CEO, Yulu.

              India’s cities can facilitate sustainable, smart and shared
              solutions for first and last-mile connectivity. If implemented
              well, these shared services like electric two-wheelers, bike
              taxis, and autos can bring users back to public transport and
              enable cities to realistically achieve their decarbonisation
              targets.
